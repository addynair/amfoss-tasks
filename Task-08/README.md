When I went through the task I assumed it was pretty easy since we were given the base code. But When I started working on it, I was getting error literally in every step. I got stuck in the circular import error. I was about to give up on this task and start another task but then I googled and got one error fixed so I got my motivation back but still the circular import was there. I googled a lot. A LOT. When one thing worked another thing gave an error. So I asked one of the mentors and got some help and finally it worked out! Even though this task drove me crazy but it was so satisfying when I got it done with. I think the task was supposed to be easy but the framework of pyside6 was soo different and I found it very hard and ended up complicating the whole task :((
