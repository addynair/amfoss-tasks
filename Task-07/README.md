Creating the extension was quite easy. I did this task before the Discord bot so it was my first time working with API. I used the request-get method to fetch my data. I used the keys from the dictionary in the json file to access whatever data I wanted. Then I linked it up with the buttons and added a simple style to the extension. I found the fetching data part confusing and kinda hard but somehow figured it out.
