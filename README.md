### Why must you choose me?

I have a strong passion towards software development and this enthusiasm motivates me to work harder in any project or task. I find new technologies fascinating and like exploring new ideas. I strongly believe that working together and being part of a team can make great things happen. I am always open to feedbacks and I am always ready to help my peers when they need it. I am good with deadlines and I am punctual and I respect other people's time.


### My goals for the next six months

My main focus is improving my coding and programming skills and for that I plan to work on personal projects. Working on coding projects will allow me to apply what I've learned and on the way will help me improve my skills by learning new things. I aim to participate in various projects, workshops and hackathons to learn from specialists and work with my peers.


### HOW WOULD I CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I am keen to contribute to the club in all possible ways. I will actively take part in club projects and events.I am always ready to share my experiences and contribute my skills whenever possible.

### FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS
Being honest, the tasks were quite challenging but the competition was the real nightmare. But the whole selection process was quite fair. My mentors were actually very nice and every weekly meeting gave me a good push to keep on working. Through the selection process, I got to realize how big of a horizon exists in this field. I gained more exposure to coding. Overall, the tasks were a completely new experience for me.
