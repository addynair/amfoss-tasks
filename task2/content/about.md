Hey everyone! I'm Aditi Nair, and I'm from the beautiful state of Kerala. My academic journey led me through the doors of Amrita Vidyalayam, where I completed my high school education.

During my time in high school, I became really interested in Informatics Practices. It's a subject that introduced me to the world of technology and coding. This got me intrigued by programming, and I quickly learned the basics of Python and MySQL. I enjoy the challenge of using code to solve problems, and I find it really satisfying. I'm excited to keep getting better at it as I move forward.

Right now, I'm starting a new phase of my education as a student at Amrita University. I'm excited about the opportunity to connect with people who share my interests and work together on interesting projects while I'm here.

Outside of my studies, I really get into books, music, and movies. I also like spending time outdoors. Whether it's playing cricket with my brother or hanging out with friends every now and then, I find joy in these activities.

Thanks for getting to know a little about me. I'm excited to connect, contribute, and learn from all of you!
