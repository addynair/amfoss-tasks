In this blog post, I'm excited to share my first-ever attempt at writing in a technical and descriptive format. The inspiration for this post comes from my experience creating a website using Hugo. Before this project, my familiarity was limited to HTML and CSS. I can't wait to share my journey and insights with you all!

[**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) stands as a static site generator, offering an array of complimentary themes. It simplifies the process of crafting captivating websites without necessitating manual code creation. Hugo-generated websites boast swiftness and security, functioning autonomously without relying on a database.

I began by installing Hugo and going through the website's documentation. To understand its features better, I created a trial website initially. Once I moved on to developing my official portfolio, I experimented with a theme called "Ananke." However, I realized it didn't quite suit the style I wanted for my portfolio. So, I switched to another theme called "m10c," and that's the one I ended up using for my portfolio website.

I began by working with the config.toml file, where I put in links to my social media profiles. Then, I tackled the "About" page. To understand some features better, I watched a few YouTube tutorials. I took a shot at creating a draft for my first blog post and also worked on the "About" page content. 

However, I noticed that the website looked a bit empty since I didn't have any projects or blogs to showcase. So, I made the decision to change the entire look of the site by choosing a different theme. This helped to give the website a fresh and more appealing appearance.

I switched to a new theme called "PaperMod." With this change, I needed to work with the .yml file. Within this file, I once again included my social media links and crafted an "About" section to appear in the menu area. During this process, I learned about the default layouts that the theme offered, which made certain aspects of customization more convenient.

Lastly, Thank you to ChatGPT for helping me fix my grammar :)
