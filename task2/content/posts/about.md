### **Hello, everyone! My name is Aditi Nair. I hail from the beautiful state of Kerala. My academic journey led me through the doors of Amrita Vidyalayam, where I successfully completed my high school education.**

### **During my high school years, I developed a strong interest in Informatics Practices, a subject that allowed me to dive into the world of technology and coding. This exposure sparked my fascination with programming, and I quickly picked up the basics of Python and MySQL. I find the process of crafting code to solve problems both challenging and rewarding, and it's a skill I'm eager to continue developing.**

### **Currently, I'm embarking on a new chapter of my educational journey as an S1 EAC student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. Connecting with like-minded individuals and collaborating on exciting projects is something I look forward to during my time here.**

### **Beyond academics, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of books, music and movies . Additionally, I find pleasure in outdoor activities, whether it's playing cricket with my brother or going out with my friends once in a while.**

### **Thank you for taking the time to get acquainted with my journey. I'm eager to forge connections, contribute positively, and learn from each of you.**
