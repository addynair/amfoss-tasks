-Cloning the Repository: I started by using the 'git clone'to copy the repo files onto my computer.

-Running the Code: After figuring out the spell file, I ran it in the terminal using 'python3     (file_name.py)'.

-Adding Changes: I used 'git status' to see which all files were changed. Then, I used 'git add filename' to pick the files I wanted to push.

-Committing Changes: I saved my work using 'git commit -m "commit message"'. The commit message described what I changed.

-Pushing Changes: To share my work in the repository, I used 'git push origin main'. This sent my changes to the main branch of the online repository.
