Discord bot was something completely new. I started off by setting up the virtual environment. Then I created the bot. I first tried making my bot to respond back to a simple user message and then I used the request-get method to fetch my data. Then I created the livescore and help command. I did face some issue with the bot not responding to the command, but I googled and figured it out.I also had to google alot to find how to put my data into a csv file. Overall, the task was quite interesting but everything was very new for me soo did face many errors. But Google baba came to save the day.
