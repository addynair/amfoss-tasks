Discord bot was completely new. I started of by setting up the virtual environment. Then I created the bot. I first tried making my bot to respond back to the user message and then Then I used the request-get method to fetch my data. Then I created the livescore and help command. I did face some issue with the bot not responding to the command, but I googled a lot and figured it out.I also had to google alot to find how to put my data into a csv file. Overall, the task was quite interesting but everything was very new for me soo did face many errors. But google baba saved me.
